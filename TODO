Split ENWordFormHandlerBCR into ENWordFormHandlerBCS and ENHeadwordHandlerBCS.
Rename ENWordFormHandler to ENHeadwordHandlerEnglish and similarly ENWordFormHandlerDefault to ENHeadwordHandlerDefault.

The idea being that handling the headword (e.g. {{sh-verb...}}) and handling
the conjugations/declinations (e.g. {{sh-conj...}}) are really two very
different things. The existing class names are miss-nomers, because so far it
seems that all word forms where deduced from information in the headwor
(which really is an "anglicism" -- this works for english where verbs only have
very few distinc forms, but not for languages like BCS or spanish)

ENSenseHandler then shouldn't need to bother about word forms at all anymore, which 
will hopefully remove all the problems I had trying to get it to process information
from multiple blocks.

We probably STILL want WiktionaryEntryParser to collect multiple lines if a
line starts with a partial template invocation (like '{{sh-conj', with the template
parameters following on the next lines).
